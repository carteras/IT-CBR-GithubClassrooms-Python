## Challenges

<em>
Educators often structure the evidence that learners can produce into categories. A simplified taxonomy of those categories are below:

* **Knowledge** - You can read some code and know what it means. 
* **Understanding** - You understand what code to write for a problem you've done before.
* **Synthesis** - You can apply what you've learnt to solve problems that you haven't exactly seen before. 

Challenges provide you with an opportunity to show your ability to synthesise your learning by solving novel problems.
